## Hello Everyone, 😊
» I am glad to announce that, I have successfully completed the PwC Switzerland Virtual Internship Program offered by Forage.
» During this program, I performed various tasks that helped me learn essential skills required for data analysis and data visualization using Power BI in a meaningful manner.

 ► Some of the tasks I accomplished include :

➡️ 𝐂𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐂𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐞 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 - Helped me understand transparency and insights into telecom industry data in detail.

➡️ 𝐂𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫 𝐑𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 - Interpreted and gained insight into customer retention and how many of them joined, as well as how they are distributed on various parameters.

➡️ 𝐃𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐲 & 𝐈𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧- Allowed me to understand gender diversity, compare FY's on the basis of gender, and calculate measures and do KPI's visualization.


 ► During this program, I strengthened my Power BI skills to better understand clients and their data visualization needs :-
